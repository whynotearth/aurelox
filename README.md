## Quick start
This template requires Node and Gulp CLI. Please follow these steps to install the required technologies:

Make sure you have Node locally installed.
Download Gulp Command Line Interface to be able to use gulp in your Terminal.
```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```
After installing Gulp, run npm install in the main neumorphism/ folder to download all the project dependencies. You’ll find them in the node_modules/ folder.
```
npm install
```
Run gulp in the neumorphism/ folder to serve the project files using BrowserSync. Running gulp will compile the theme and open /index.html in your main browser.
```
gulp
```
While the gulp command is running, files in the assets/scss/, assets/js/ and components/ folders will be monitored for changes. Files from the assets/scss/ folder will generate injected CSS.

Hit CTRL+C to terminate the gulp command. This will stop the local server from running.

## Theme without Sass, Gulp or Npm
If you’d like to get a version of our theme without Sass, Gulp or Npm, we’ve got you covered. Run the following command:

```
gulp build:dev
```
This will generate a folder html&css which will have unminified CSS, Html and Javascript.

Minified version
If you’d like to compile the code and get a minified version of the HTML and CSS just run the following Gulp command:
```
gulp build:dist
```
This will generate a folder dist which will have minified CSS, Html and Javascript.
